        <p>Limbus Company takes place in a dystopian world known as the City, made of twenty-six districts, each unique in technological advancements and culture. 
            The 26 Wings, mega-corporations named after alphabet letters that govern their respective Districts, are led by the Head, a conglomerate consisting of A Corp, B Corp and C Corp. 
            Each District is physically split into a Nest, the urban residence supported by the Corps, and the Backstreets, the poverty-ridden areas overrun by criminal Syndicates and outside of the Corps' protection.

            The player takes the role of Dante, an amnesiac whose head was recently severed in favor of a clock shaped prosthetic. Just before they are about to be executed, Dante is rescued by the Limbus Company Bus Department, 
            who inform them of their new role as the manager of the team and their quest to find the Golden Boughs, a rare artifact that spawned across the city after the fall of Lobotomy Corporation. The game is split into chapters, named "Cantos", which are all character-driven and delve into the Sinners' past and trauma on their quest.

            The main party of Limbus Company is composed of 13 "Sinners", brought together under some form of contract with the titular Limbus Company.
            Dante is considered one of these Sinners, though they do not actively participate in combat. 
            Joining them is Vergilius and Charon, who serve as the team's guide and bus driver respectively.

            General Plot: An amnesiac Dante is recruited by Limbus Company to act as executive manager to the Limbus Company Bus Department, a group of twelve Sinners who travel through the City on Mephistopheles, a bus with unique abilities, to collect the Golden Boughs left behind at old Lobotomy Corporation facilities. 
            Dante and the Sinners enter a contract with each other that allows Dante to reverse time for them, a power which they use to heal their injuries and even bring them back from death.
            The story is divided into the Inferno (main story chapters, also known as Cantos) and the Deviazione (detour tales, also known as Intervallos). Each Canto follows the LCB on a mission to retrieve a Golden Bough and the story centers around a specific Sinner as they discover that the location where the Golden Bough resides or the people who currently own it are related to their past.

            Most of the game's themes are based on books. The name of some characters (Vergilius and Dante) and the name of the stories (Cantos and Intervallos) are based on Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy."
            The 12 Sinners are based on book characters; although slightly changed to fit the game's narrative.
